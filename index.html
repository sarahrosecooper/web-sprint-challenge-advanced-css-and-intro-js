    1.) How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
    Accesibility is about making sure that whatever you are creating is ACCESSIBLE to all who may interact with it. This includes those who may be colorblind, use screenreaders, visually impaired, etc, as well making sure that your website is accesible and responsive for all viewports.
2.) Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.
 Use a color wheel to make color pairs that are more viable for those who are colorblind.
 Make sure to use alt tags in all images for those who may be using screen readers.
 Use responsive text by defaulting to rems/ems instead of pixels for ease of use for those who need to adjust their font size.
3.) How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
I would describe a variable as a container, something created to store something that you can pick up off the shelf anytime you need it.
$.) What is the purpose of using functions in code? 
The purpose of using functions in code is to keep your code "DRY (do not repeat yourself)" and ease of performing a task. ---->

          Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen);
          30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter
          who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of
          Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks,
          including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years
          of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and
          self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic,
          impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations
          of modern art. However, he was not commercially successful, and his
          suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.
